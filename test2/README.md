## Test Overview: Full-Stack Web Application

### Introduction
In this challenge, you are positioned in a forward-thinking startup specializing in data analytics tools. Your task is to build a vital component of our data analytics web application â€“ the `DataTable` component. This component is responsible for displaying complex data fetched from a backend server, crafted using React and TypeScript on the frontend and Python with Firebase on the backend. Your expertise will transform this concept into a functional, user-focused application.

### Objectives
- **Develop a `DataTable` Component**: Create a component in React to display data from a backend server.
- **Backend Development**: Set up a backend using Python and Firebase to serve data.
- **State Management and Hosting**: Implement state management and deploy the application using Firebase Hosting.
- **Focus on End-to-End Functionality**: Emphasize both frontend and backend integration.

### Duration
- Primary Task: 2-3 hours.
