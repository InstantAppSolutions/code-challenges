## Test Overview: Packaging React Components into a Library

### Introduction
As part of our dynamic software development team, your mission is to develop a Node module library. This library will package a set of existing React components, optimizing them for general usability and reusability. Your primary task is to create a basic `DataTable` component with CRUD functionality and refactor additional components to form a cornerstone of our reusable component library.

### Objectives
- **Develop a `DataTable` Component**: Create a component with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
- **Refactor Existing Components**: Optimize additional components for generic use, ensuring they are reusable and well-structured.
- **Sample Application**: Demonstrate the use of these components in a sample React application.
- **Focus on Quality**: Emphasize code quality and efficient problem-solving.

### Duration
- Primary Task: 2-3 hours.
