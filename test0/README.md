## Test Overview: Building a Nested Todo List with React

### Introduction
In the fast-paced world of software development, task management is key. You have been tasked with creating a nested todo list application using React, with particular attention to user experience and functionality. This application should allow users to create tasks, nest subtasks, and manage them with intuitive interactions.

--------------------------------------------------------------
| Todo List App                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Input field for new task] [Add Task Button]               |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task 1 ........................................ [Edit][Del] |
| - Subtask 1.1 ............................... [Edit][Del]   |
| - Subtask 1.2 ............................... [Edit][Del]   |
|   - Subtask 1.2.1 ........................... [Edit][Del]   |
|     - Subtask 1.2.1.1 ...................... [Edit][Del]    |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task 2 ........................................ [Edit][Del] |
| - Subtask 2.1 ............................... [Edit][Del]   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task 3 ........................................ [Edit][Del] |
| - Subtask 3.1 ............................... [Edit][Del]   |
|   - Subtask 3.1.1 ........................... [Edit][Del]   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

### Objectives
- **Develop a Nested Todo List**: Create a React application where tasks can be added, nested, edited, and deleted.
- **State Management**: Implement robust state management to keep track of all tasks and subtasks.
- **User Interactions**: Enable users to interact with the application in a user-friendly manner.
- **Styling with TailwindCSS**: Ensure the application is well-styled and showcasing modern design practices (using TailwindCSS is optional)

### Bonus
- **Drag and drop**:  Enable users to reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them.
- **Advanced filtering and sorting**: Allow users to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria.
- **Persistent storage**: Store tasks in a database to ensure they are not lost when the application is closed.

### Duration
- Primary Task: 2-3 hours.
